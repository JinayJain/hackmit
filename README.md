# HandOff
Find new hands for your used college items.

## About

We are building a platform to facilitate the sustainable usage of goods by offering a simple and intuitive thrifting system for the reuse of college items. As students in our respective schools, we have all witnessed firsthand the sheer amount of perfectly usable furniture, electronic equipment, clothing, and books that end up in the garbage simply because it was “too much work” and/or “time consuming” to properly find new homes for them. Struck by the enormity of the lost potential value to our communities, we decided that we would tackle this problem by building an online system for the effortless hand off of goods from one owner to the next. Our goal is to eliminate the wasteful cultural norms of purchase and toss out that we have grown accustomed to and to dispel the myth that sustainability comes at the cost of affordability.


## Tech Stack
We used React.js, Next.js, Chakra-UI, IBM Cloudant and AWS S3 Bucket for our tech stack.
